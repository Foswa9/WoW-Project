<!--
    Proposed idea.
    The purpose of this website is to connect players with other like-minded players.
    This should be the substitute for the current in game system as it is god awful.

    The way in which this website will be popular or not will be in execution.
    So how do I know if I exectued well?
        1.Ease of use, should be convenient to use. Simple and concise. Once again AOE world is the best website I have ever seen in its simplicity and ease of use.
        2.How many players use this system. AKA if only 10% of the playerbase use this meaning you only see 10% of potential people to play with, it will not be used.
        Perhaps linking it with battle.net will circumvent this. Battlenet will be the main ID of the player.
        3.Does it actually work.
    What does it mean if the app works?


    There is no reason for me to convince anyone on how awfull the solo experience is.
    Could this website also be the defacto talent/job board and replace the current wowprogress and warcraft progress for recruiting atleast.
    Those other websites are ofcourse used for other features aswell.
